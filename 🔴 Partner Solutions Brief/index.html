              <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                Maintaining compliance with a myriad of internal security 
                standards (e.g., SANS 20 CSC, COBIT, ITIL) and/or external 
                industry and government regulations (e.g., PCI, HIPAA,
                PCI) is a challenging task by any measure. Most IT 
                security standards and regulations call for monitoring 
                systems for unpatched vulnerabilities, but generating 
                adequate audit reports is nearly impossible without 
                performing credentialed network scans. And for some 
                environments, credentialed scanning is either impractical 
                or against internal IT policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, some rudimentary vulnerability scanning 
                solutions are only equipped with checks for recent 
                system vulnerabilities, while others lack adequate 
                coverage for certain Linux-based platforms. Also, most 
                scanners cannot properly identify backported Linux 
                patches, making accurately depicting Linux vulnerabilities 
                next to impossible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without a best-of-breed vulnerability management solution,
                Red Hat customers, in particular, face the following 
                two challenges:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Inability to generate adequate vulnerability management 
                  reports for compliance auditors depicting the patch 
                  status of internal IT Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL
                  ) systems when credentialed scanning is not possible
                </li>

                <li>
                  Inability to detect both recent and legacy vulnerabilities 
                  and security miscon gurations within RHEL hosts
                </li>

                <li>
                  Inability to identify backported patches to avoid 
                  false positive Linux vulnerabilities
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2> Solution Overview </h2>

              <p> 
                Red Hat Network Satellite is an easy-to-use systems 
                management platform that makes managing hundreds of 
                RHEL hosts as easy as managing one. It provides powerful 
                systems administration capabilities, including provisioning,
                monitoring, and patch management. For RHEL environments 
                where credentialed scanning is not possible, Tenable 
                Nessus can interface with Red Hat’s Network Satellite 
                API to automatically import—in real time—the patch 
                status.
              </p>

              <p> 
                of all monitored RHEL hosts. This intelligence is then 
                shared with the Tenable SecurityCenter management console 
                to be incorporated into compliance reports.
              </p>

              <p> 
                Tenable offers thousands of plugins/checks for detecting 
                both recent and legacy vulnerabilities and security 
                miscon gurations within your RHEL environment. Tenable 
                PVS passively monitors RHEL hosts for vulnerabilities 
                in between periodic Nessus active scans, and Tenable 
                LCE identi es new RHEL hosts for scanning on network 
                segments not monitored by PVS.
              </p>

              <h2>How it Works</h2>
              <p>
                Step 1: Nessus interfaces with Red Hat Network Satellite API and imports the patch status of each monitored RHEL host—including identifying backported patches. This intelligence is then shared with the SecurityCenter for compliance reporting.

                <i>
                  By importing patch status of all RHEL hosts monitored by Red Hat Network
                  Satellite into Nessus, compliance auditors can incorporate RHEL patch
                  intelligence into their SecurityCenter compliance reports.

                <h2>
                  Integration Benefits
                </h2>

                <p>
                  Tenable makes it easy to incorporate the patch status of RHEL
                  hosts monitored by Red Hat Network Satellite into SecurityCenter 
                  compliance reports. This is particularly important for Red Hat 
                  customers that have restrictions on performing credentialed scans 
                  of internal systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Also, since Nessus and PVS are equipped with thousands of plugins/
                  checks speci cally designed to detect vulnerabilities and security
                  miscon gurations within RHEL hosts—while LCE identi es new RHEL hosts
                  to be scanned by Nessus—Red Hat customers gain peace of mind knowing
                  that their Tenable vulnerability management solution will protect their
                  RHEL investment.
                </p>

              <div class="fifty" style="padding-left: 3em;">
                <p>
                  The benefits of a joint Tenable-Red Hat solution can be summarized
                  as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Incorporate RHEL systems’ patch status into SecurityCenter 
                    compliance reports
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Detect recent and legacy vulnerabilities and security miscon
                    gurations within RHEL hosts
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Passively detect security concerns within RHEL hosts in between
                    periodic Nessus active scans
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Identify new RHEL hosts to be scanned by Nessus on network 
                    segments not monitored by PVS
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Eliminate false positive Linux vulnerabilities by properly 
                    identifying backported RHEL patches
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Leverage RHEL as an ideal platform to host Tenable SecurityCenter,
